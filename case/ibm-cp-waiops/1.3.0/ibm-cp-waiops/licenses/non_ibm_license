GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, VERSION 2

The Program includes some or all of the following licensed to you as
Separately Licensed Code under the GNU General Public License. For copies
of the source code for this software, send an email to ai4itops@us.ibm.com 
identifying the IBM product and the GPL-licensed program for which you
are requesting the source code

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can
apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is
a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or
run modified versions of the software inside them, although
the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible
with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it
is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version
of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the
GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software
patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development
and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those
that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.
To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees"
and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than
the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a
"modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on"
the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities
as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with
a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal
Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the
interface presents a list of user commands or options, such
as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. "Object code"
means any non-source form of a work.
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either
is an official standard defined by a recognized standards
body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a
particular programming language, one that is widely used
among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include
anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is
included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,
but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which
an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
the specific operating system (if any) on which the
executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code
form means all the source code needed to generate,
install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include
the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools
or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which
are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code
for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
that the work is specifically designed to require, such
as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything
that users can regenerate automatically from other
parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output
from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
covered work. This License acknowledges your rights
of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that
you do not convey, without conditions so long as
your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running
those works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
solely under the conditions stated below.
Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention
Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective
technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling
obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting
or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power
to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the
extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights
under this License with respect to the covered work, and
you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with
the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that
you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the
modifications to produce it from the Program, in the
form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under
section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in
section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section
7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
independent works, which are not by their nature extensions
of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such
as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, in one of these ways:
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than
your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server
at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
any tangible personal property which is normally used for
personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed
or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether
a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved
in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common
use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.
A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of
use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
continued functioning of the modified object code is in no
case prevented or interfered with solely because modification
has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or
with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the
conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right
of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to
the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless
of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not
apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability
to install modified object code on the User Product (for
example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does
not include a requirement to continue to provide support
service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access
to a network may be denied when the modification itself
materially and adversely affects the operation of the
network or violates the rules and protocols for
communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions
from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire
Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional
permissions apply only to part of the Program,
that part may be used separately under those
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
by this License without regard to the additional
permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
for material you add to a covered work, you may (if
authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of
this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable
legal notices or author attributions in that material
or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that
material, or requiring that modified versions of such
material be marked in reasonable ways as different from
the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of
licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for
use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of
that material by anyone who conveys the material (or
modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
"further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.
If the Program as you received it, or any part of it,
contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material
governed by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
section, you must place, in the relevant source files,
a statement of the additional terms that apply to those
files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
stated in the form of a separately written license, or
stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
older notifies you of the violation by some reasonable
means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to
30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order
to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
propagation of a covered work occurring solely as
a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating
a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
[License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring
control of an organization, or substantially all assets
of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results
from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest
had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right
to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise
of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For
example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other
charge for exercise of rights granted under this License,
and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or
importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
"contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent
claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether
already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be
infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent
claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly
relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent
license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your
recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of,
a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include
within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the
rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to
refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work
licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting
work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements
of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the GNU General Public License from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on
any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to
follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the
Program in return for a fee.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, VERSION 2

The Program includes some or all of the following licensed to you as
Separately Licensed Code under the GNU General Public License. For copies
of the source code for this software, send an email to <ai4itops@us.ibm.com>
identifying the IBM product and the GPL-licensed program for which you
are requesting the source code

[MongoDB]


Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can
apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is
a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or
run modified versions of the software inside them, although
the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible
with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it
is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version
of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the
GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software
patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development
and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those
that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.
To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees"
and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than
the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a
"modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on"
the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities
as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with
a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal
Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the
interface presents a list of user commands or options, such
as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. "Object code"
means any non-source form of a work.
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either
is an official standard defined by a recognized standards
body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a
particular programming language, one that is widely used
among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include
anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is
included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,
but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which
an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
the specific operating system (if any) on which the
executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code
form means all the source code needed to generate,
install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include
the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools
or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which
are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code
for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
that the work is specifically designed to require, such
as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything
that users can regenerate automatically from other
parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output
from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
covered work. This License acknowledges your rights
of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that
you do not convey, without conditions so long as
your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running
those works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
solely under the conditions stated below.
Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention
Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective
technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling
obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting
or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power
to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the
extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights
under this License with respect to the covered work, and
you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with
the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that
you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the
modifications to produce it from the Program, in the
form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under
section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in
section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section
7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
independent works, which are not by their nature extensions
of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such
as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, in one of these ways:
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than
your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server
at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
any tangible personal property which is normally used for
personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed
or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether
a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved
in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common
use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.
A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of
use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
continued functioning of the modified object code is in no
case prevented or interfered with solely because modification
has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or
with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the
conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right
of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to
the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless
of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not
apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability
to install modified object code on the User Product (for
example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does
not include a requirement to continue to provide support
service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access
to a network may be denied when the modification itself
materially and adversely affects the operation of the
network or violates the rules and protocols for
communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions
from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire
Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional
permissions apply only to part of the Program,
that part may be used separately under those
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
by this License without regard to the additional
permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
for material you add to a covered work, you may (if
authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of
this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable
legal notices or author attributions in that material
or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that
material, or requiring that modified versions of such
material be marked in reasonable ways as different from
the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of
licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for
use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of
that material by anyone who conveys the material (or
modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
"further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.
If the Program as you received it, or any part of it,
contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material
governed by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
section, you must place, in the relevant source files,
a statement of the additional terms that apply to those
files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
stated in the form of a separately written license, or
stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
older notifies you of the violation by some reasonable
means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to
30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order
to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
propagation of a covered work occurring solely as
a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating
a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
[License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring
control of an organization, or substantially all assets
of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results
from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest
had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right
to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise
of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For
example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other
charge for exercise of rights granted under this License,
and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or
importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
"contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent
claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether
already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be
infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent
claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly
relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent
license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your
recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of,
a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include
within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the
rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to
refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work
licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting
work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements
of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the GNU General Public License from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on
any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to
follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the
Program in return for a fee.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

Separately Licensed Code under the GNU General Public License. For copies
of the source code for this software, send an email to <ai4itops@us.ibm.com>

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can
apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is
a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or
run modified versions of the software inside them, although
the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible
with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it
is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version
of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the
GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software
patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development
and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those
that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.
To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees"
and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than
the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a
"modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on"
the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities
as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with
a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal
Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the
interface presents a list of user commands or options, such
as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. "Object code"
means any non-source form of a work.
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either
is an official standard defined by a recognized standards
body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a
particular programming language, one that is widely used
among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include
anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is
included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,
but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which
an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
the specific operating system (if any) on which the
executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code
form means all the source code needed to generate,
install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include
the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools
or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which
are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code
for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
that the work is specifically designed to require, such
as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything
that users can regenerate automatically from other
parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output
from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
covered work. This License acknowledges your rights
of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that
you do not convey, without conditions so long as
your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running
those works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
solely under the conditions stated below.
Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention
Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective
technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling
obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting
or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power
to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the
extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights
under this License with respect to the covered work, and
you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with
the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that
you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the
modifications to produce it from the Program, in the
form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under
section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in
section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section
7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
independent works, which are not by their nature extensions
of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such
as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, in one of these ways:
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than
your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server
at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
any tangible personal property which is normally used for
personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed
or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether
a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved
in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common
use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.
A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of
use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
continued functioning of the modified object code is in no
case prevented or interfered with solely because modification
has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or
with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the
conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right
of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to
the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless
of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not
apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability
to install modified object code on the User Product (for
example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does
not include a requirement to continue to provide support
service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access
to a network may be denied when the modification itself
materially and adversely affects the operation of the
network or violates the rules and protocols for
communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions
from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire
Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional
permissions apply only to part of the Program,
that part may be used separately under those
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
by this License without regard to the additional
permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
for material you add to a covered work, you may (if
authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of
this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable
legal notices or author attributions in that material
or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that
material, or requiring that modified versions of such
material be marked in reasonable ways as different from
the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of
licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for
use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of
that material by anyone who conveys the material (or
modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
"further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.
If the Program as you received it, or any part of it,
contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material
governed by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
section, you must place, in the relevant source files,
a statement of the additional terms that apply to those
files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
stated in the form of a separately written license, or
stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
older notifies you of the violation by some reasonable
means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to
30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order
to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
propagation of a covered work occurring solely as
a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating
a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
[License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring
control of an organization, or substantially all assets
of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results
from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest
had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right
to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise
of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For
example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other
charge for exercise of rights granted under this License,
and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or
importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
"contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent
claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether
already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be
infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent
claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly
relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent
license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your
recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of,
a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include
within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the
rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to
refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work
licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting
work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements
of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the GNU General Public License from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on
any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to
follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the
Program in return for a fee.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
            Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

               Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
   charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
   the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
   is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
   in the event an application does not supply such function or
   table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
   its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
   a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
   application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
   application-supplied function or table used by this function must
   be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
   root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
   with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
   uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
   user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
   executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
   Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
   to use the modified definitions.)

   b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
   Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
   copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
   rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
   will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
   the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
   interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

   c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
   least three years, to give the same user the materials
   specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
   than the cost of performing this distribution.

   d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
   specified materials from the same place.

   e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
   materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
   based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
   facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
   Sections above.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
   that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
   where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

               NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, this License refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the  GNU GPL refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

The Library refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An  Applicationis any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A Combined Work is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the â€œLinked Versionâ€.

The Minimal Corresponding Source for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The Corresponding Application Code for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   d) Do one of the following:
     0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
     1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License or any later versionâ€ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

UnboundID LDAP SDK Free Use License

The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the
UnboundID LDAP SDK Free Use License:

- unboundid-ldapsdk-se 

THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU ("YOU") AND PING IDENTITY CORPORATION
("PING IDENTITY") REGARDING YOUR USE OF UNBOUNDID LDAP SDK FOR JAVA AND ANY
ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION, OBJECT CODE, COMPILED LIBRARIES, SOURCE CODE AND
SOURCE FILES OR OTHER MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE BY PING IDENTITY (COLLECTIVELY
REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT AS THE ("SDK").

BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SDK, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT
INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE SDK.

USE OF THE SDK.  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Ping Identity
grants to You a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Ping Identity's
intellectual property rights in the SDK, to use, reproduce, modify and
distribute this release of the SDK; provided that no license is granted herein
under any patents that may be infringed by your modifications, derivative works
or by other works in which the SDK may be incorporated (collectively, your
Applications").  You may reproduce and redistribute the SDK with your
Applications provided that you (i) include this license file and an
unmodified copy of the unboundid-ldapsdk.jar file; and (ii) such
redistribution is subject to a license whose terms do not conflict with or
contradict the terms of this Agreement. You may also reproduce and redistribute
the SDK without your Applications provided that you redistribute the SDK
complete and unmodified (i.e., with all "read me" files, copyright notices, and
other legal notices and terms that Ping Identity has included in the SDK).

SCOPE OF LICENSES.  This Agreement does not grant You the right to use any Ping
Identity intellectual property which is not included as part of the SDK.  The
SDK is licensed, not sold.  This Agreement only gives You some rights to use
the SDK.  Ping Identity reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives
You more rights despite this limitation, You may use the SDK only as expressly
permitted in this Agreement.

SUPPORT.  Ping Identity is not obligated to provide any technical or other
support ("Support Services") for the SDK to You under this Agreement. However,
if Ping Identity chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use of
such Support Services will be governed by then-current Ping Identity support
policies.

TERMINATION.  Ping Identity reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK
and to modify the SDK at any time in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Ping Identity may also,
in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the SDK to You or any
end user at any time.  In addition, if you fail to comply with the terms of
this Agreement, then any rights granted herein will be automatically terminated
if such failure is not corrected within 30 days of the initial notification of
such failure.  You acknowledge that termination and/or monetary damages may not
be a sufficient remedy if You breach this Agreement and that Ping Identity will
be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or
equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction
in the event of a breach.  Ping Identity may also terminate this Agreement if
the SDK becomes, or in Ping Identity's reasonable opinion is likely to become,
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret
misappropriation.  All rights and licenses granted herein will simultaneously
and automatically terminate upon termination of this Agreement for any reason.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND PING IDENTITY DOES NOT
WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL BE ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, WILL PERFORM IN AN
UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR TIMELY MANNER, OR WILL INTEROPERATE WITH OTHER
HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ALL
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF PING IDENTITY HAD
BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS ARE
HEREBY DISCLAIMED.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL PING IDENTITY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS,
REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COST OF COVER, DIRECT,
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND)
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF PING IDENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.  Certain states do not allow the exclusion of implied
warranties or limitation of liability for certain kinds of damages, so the
exclusion of limited warranties and limitation of liability set forth above may
not apply to You.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The SDK is subject to United States export control laws.
You acknowledge and agree that You are responsible for compliance with all
domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the SDK.

MISCELLANEOUS.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement with respect to
the SDK.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. This
Agreement and performance hereunder shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflict
of laws rules.  Any disputes related to this Agreement shall be exclusively
litigated in the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas.

   Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license:

    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
       trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use,
       reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
       distribute the Original Software (or portions thereof),

       dispose of the Original Software (or portions thereof).

    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are
       effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
       or otherwise makes the Original Software available to a
       third party under the terms of this License.

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
       granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original
       Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the

       Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
       Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

   3.1. Availability of Source Code.

   Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
   available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
   Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
   the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this
   License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
   Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must
   inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
   as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
   form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
   used for software exchange.

   3.2. Modifications.

   The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
   governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You
   believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
   You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
   License.

   3.3. Required Notices.

   You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
   identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may
   not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
   contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
   or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
   the Initial Developer.

   3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

   You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
   Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
   of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may
   choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
   Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
   and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
   You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
   hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
   Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
   such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
   liability terms You offer.

   3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

   You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
   under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
   Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
   provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
   and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
   limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
   the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
   Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
   must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
   this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
   Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
   Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
   by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
   such terms You offer.

   3.6. Larger Works.

   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
   other code not governed by the terms of this License and
   distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
   You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
   for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

   4.1. New Versions.

   Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
   publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
   time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
   Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
   steward has the right to modify this License.

   4.2. Effect of New Versions.

   You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
   Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
   License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
   If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
   Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
   available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
   distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
   of the version of the License under which You originally received
   the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
   distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
   the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
   the license steward.

   4.3. Modified Versions.

   When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
   license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
   modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
   and remove any references to the name of the license steward
  (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
  (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
   differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
   SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
   PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
   COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
   INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
   WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
   ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
   DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

   6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
   cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
   the termination of this License shall survive.

   6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
   declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
   Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
   assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
   the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
   the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
   the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
   indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
   the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
   under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
   notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
   at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
   such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
   Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
   or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

   6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
   all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
   distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
   granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
   INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
   COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
   LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
   STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
   COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
   INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
   LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
   NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
   APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
   defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
   computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
   C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
   documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
  (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
c. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
 c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
 d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
    organization that transmits the broadcast.
 f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
    considered a literary or artistic work.
 g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
    medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:

     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
        of the rights granted under this License; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(b), as requested.
 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
    this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
    applicable law.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License 

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can
apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is
a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or
run modified versions of the software inside them, although
the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible
with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it
is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version
of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the
GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software
patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development
and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those
that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.
To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees"
and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than
the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a
"modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on"
the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities
as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with
a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal
Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the
interface presents a list of user commands or options, such
as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. "Object code"
means any non-source form of a work.
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either
is an official standard defined by a recognized standards
body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a
particular programming language, one that is widely used
among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include
anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is
included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component,
but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
serves only to enable use of the work with that Major
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which
an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
the specific operating system (if any) on which the
executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code
form means all the source code needed to generate,
install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include
the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools
or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which
are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code
for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
that the work is specifically designed to require, such
as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything
that users can regenerate automatically from other
parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output
from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
covered work. This License acknowledges your rights
of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that
you do not convey, without conditions so long as
your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running
those works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
solely under the conditions stated below.
Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention
Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective
technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling
obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting
or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power
to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the
extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights
under this License with respect to the covered work, and
you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with
the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that
you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the
modifications to produce it from the Program, in the
form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under
section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in
section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section
7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
independent works, which are not by their nature extensions
of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such
as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, in one of these ways:
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than
your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server
at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
any tangible personal property which is normally used for
personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed
or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether
a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved
in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common
use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.
A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of
use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
continued functioning of the modified object code is in no
case prevented or interfered with solely because modification
has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or
with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the
conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right
of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to
the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless
of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not
apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability
to install modified object code on the User Product (for
example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does
not include a requirement to continue to provide support
service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access
to a network may be denied when the modification itself
materially and adversely affects the operation of the
network or violates the rules and protocols for
communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions
from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire
Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional
permissions apply only to part of the Program,
that part may be used separately under those
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
by this License without regard to the additional
permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
for material you add to a covered work, you may (if
authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of
this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable
legal notices or author attributions in that material
or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that
material, or requiring that modified versions of such
material be marked in reasonable ways as different from
the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of
licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for
use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of
that material by anyone who conveys the material (or
modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
"further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.
If the Program as you received it, or any part of it,
contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material
governed by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
section, you must place, in the relevant source files,
a statement of the additional terms that apply to those
files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
stated in the form of a separately written license, or
stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
older notifies you of the violation by some reasonable
means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to
30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order
to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
propagation of a covered work occurring solely as
a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating
a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
[License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring
control of an organization, or substantially all assets
of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results
from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest
had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right
to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise
of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For
example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other
charge for exercise of rights granted under this License,
and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or
importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
"contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent
claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether
already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be
infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent
claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly
relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent
license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your
recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of,
a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include
within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the
rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to
refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work
licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting
work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements
of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the GNU General Public License from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on
any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to
follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the
Program in return for a fee.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF

PREAMBLE

This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of the fonts.  

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.  

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as received under this licence.  

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.  

"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a copyright ownership of the Font Software.  

"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.  

To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such rights are reserved.  

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to the below conditions:  

1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine- readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.  

2) The font name complies with the following:

(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.

(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.

(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of the new work, appended to that name.  

3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with their explicit written permission.  

4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software, except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this licence.  

TERMINATION

This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.  

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

Attribution License (ODC-By)

PREAMBLE
The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement
intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database
subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not
the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish
to use this license together with another license for the contents.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over
information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have
to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities
not covered by this License.

The Licensor (as defined below)

and

You (as defined below)

agree as follows:

1.0 DEFINITIONS OF CAPITALISED WORDS
"Collective Database" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.

"Convey" - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.

"Contents" - The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.

"Database" - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License.

"Database Directive" - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.

"Database Right" - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ("sui generis") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.

"Derivative Database" - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.

"Extraction" - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.

"License" - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.

"Licensor" - Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License.

"Person" - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.

"Produced Work" - a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.

"Publicly" - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).

"Re-utilisation" - means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission.

"Substantial" - Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.

"Use" - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.

"You" - Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.

2.0 WHAT THIS LICENSE COVERS
2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:

a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;

b. A license of the Database Right; and

c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.

2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
Database, including:

a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The
copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but
does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this
Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between
jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema,
which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database,
and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data
entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the
Database;

b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed
from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not
infringe any applicable copyright; and

c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use
on this access as outlined in this License.

2.3 Rights not covered.

a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making
or operation of the Database;

b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
Database; and

c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the
Database.

2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.

For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of
the rights over the images.

3.0 RIGHTS GRANTED
3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the
future.

The rights granted cover, for example:

a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
the Contents;

b. Creation of Derivative Databases;

c. Creation of Collective Databases;

d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in
any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or
as a part of Collective Databases; and

e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
Databases.

3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:

a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License; and,

c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License.

3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.

4.0 CONDITIONS OF USE
4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be
in material breach of its terms.

4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You
must:

a. Do so only under the terms of this License;

b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the
Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;

c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that
refer to this License; and

d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular
file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to
look for it.

4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it
is available under this License.

a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section
4.3:

Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available
under the ODC Attribution License.
DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
hyperlink to the location of the Database. â€œODC Attribution Licenseâ€�
should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
required URIâ€(TM)s with the above notice.

4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.

5.0 MORAL RIGHTS
5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment
that would otherwise prejudice the authorâ€(TM)s honour and reputation, or
any other derogatory treatment:

a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives
all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest
extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section
10.4;

b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant
jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral
rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the
fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under
Section 10.4; and

c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their
moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.

Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
jurisdictions.

6.0 FAIR DEALING, DATABASE EXCEPTIONS, AND OTHER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED
6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
Database, including without limitation:

a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents
from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and
Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or
judicial procedure.

b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or
exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.

6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the
Contents.

7.0 WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER
7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor â€œas isâ€� and without any
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
this exclusion may not apply to You.

8.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on
the part of the Licensor.

9.0 TERMINATION OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE
9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted
under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will
survive any termination of this License.

9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor
will not terminate Your rights under it.

9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.

9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License
will be reinstated:

a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day
after cessation of breach;

b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless
otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation,
this is the first time You have received notice of violation of this
License from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days
after your receipt of the notice.

9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

10.0 GENERAL
10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
the Database.

10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any
breach by the Licensor.

10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
terms of this License.

European Union Public Licence
V. 1.1

EUPL (c) the European Community 2007


This European Union Public Licence (the "EUPL") applies to the Work or
Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence.
Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited
(to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the
Work).

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the
Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following
the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1 or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the
EUPL.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

* The Licence: this Licence.

* The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or
communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source
Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.

* Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the
Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;
this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country
mentioned in Article 15.

* The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.

* The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
convenient for people to study and modify.

* The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and
which is
meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

* The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or
communicates the Work under the Licence.

* Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work
under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

* The Licensee or "You": any natural or legal person who makes any usage
of the Software under the terms of the Licence.

* Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving,
lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access
to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or
legal person.


2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright
vested in the Original Work:

* use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
* reproduce the Work,
* modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
* communicate to the public, including the right to make available or
display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the
case may be, the Work,
* distribute the Work or copies thereof,
* lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
* sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats,
whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right
to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage
rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.


3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the
Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the
Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or
indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a
repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.


4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the
benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights
owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or
of other applicable limitations thereto.


5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions
and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the
following:

- Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright,
patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such
notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes
and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to
carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date
of modification.

- Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates
copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work,
this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this
Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work
is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The
Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or
conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the
terms of the Licence.

- Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates
Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and
another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution
and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence.
For the sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence" refers to the licences
listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's
obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under
this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

- Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating
copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and
freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or
communicate the Work. Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant
permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names
of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
copyright notice.


6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has
the
power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
brings
to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
has the
power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work,
under the
terms of this Licence.


7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by
numerous
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain
defects or
"bugs" inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as
is"
basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
without
limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of
defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
rights
other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
condition
for the grant of any rights to the Work.


8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
natural
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or
indirect,
material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of
the
use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
commercial
damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product
liability
laws as far such laws apply to the Work.


9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose
to
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of
support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
services
consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations,
You may
act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on
behalf of
the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You
have
accepted any such warranty or additional liability.


10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I
agree"
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence
or by
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules
of
applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and
irrevocable
acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a
Derivative Work
or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies
thereof.


11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of
electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download
the Work
from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example,
a
website) must at least provide to the public the information requested
by the
applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.


12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon
any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such
persons
remain in full compliance with the Licence.


13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the
complete
agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable
law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence
as a
whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary
to make
it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new
versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable,
without
reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of
the
Licence will be published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European
Commission,
have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic
version of
their choice.


14. Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License,
arising
between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will
be
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European
Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the
European Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European
Commission, and
resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to
the
exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides
or
conducts its primary business.


15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country
where
the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

* a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor,
and any
Licensee;
* the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or
registered office inside a European Union country.

Server Side Public License version 1

The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the 
Server Side Public License version 1:

MONGODB

Server Side Public License
                     VERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018

                    Copyright (C) 2018 MongoDB, Inc.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
  
  ìThis Licenseî refers to Server Side Public License.

  ìCopyrightî also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  ìThe Programî refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as ìyouî. ìLicenseesî and
  ìrecipientsî may be individuals or organizations.

  To ìmodifyî a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
  a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy. The resulting work is called a ìmodified versionî of the
  earlier work or a work ìbased onî the earlier work.

  A ìcovered workî means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
  the Program.

  To ìpropagateî a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To ìconveyî a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
  computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays ìAppropriate Legal Noticesî to the
  extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
  (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
  there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
  are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
  how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of
  user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
  meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The ìsource codeî for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. ìObject codeî means any non-source form of a
  work.

  A ìStandard Interfaceî means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
  widely used among developers working in that language.  The ìSystem
  Librariesî of an executable work include anything, other than the work as
  a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
  Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves
  only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement
  a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the
  public in source code form. A ìMajor Componentî, in this context, means a
  major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
  specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or
  a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
  to run it.

  The ìCorresponding Sourceî for a work in object code form means all the
  source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
  the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
  those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
  Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
  which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
  not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes
  interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and
  the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
  that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
  data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
  parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
  regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program, subject to section 13. The
  output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the
  output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
  acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
  copyright law.  Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate
  covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your
  license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to
  others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively
  for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
  that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
  material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
  running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
  behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them
  from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
  relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
  conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
  unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
  of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
  prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
  effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
  covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,
  your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
  intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
  added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
  of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this
  License along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for
  each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
  protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
  of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
    and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ìkeep intact all
    noticesî.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
    apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the
    whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
    packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any
    other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
    separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
    need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
  which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on
  a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ìaggregateî if
  the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
  access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
  individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does
  not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
  
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
  sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
  Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
  ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
    used for software interchange.
   
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
    offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
    offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
    anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
    Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
    covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
    for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost
    of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to
    copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
   
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
    allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
    the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
   
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy
    the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on
    a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
    equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
    next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
    Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
    obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
    satisfy these requirements.
   
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
    subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
  in conveying the object code work.

  A ìUser Productî is either (1) a ìconsumer productî, which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
  product received by a particular user, ìnormally usedî refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.

  ìInstallation Informationî for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
  of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
  Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
  (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
  Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the
  Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither
  you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object
  code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in
  ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access
  to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially
  and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the
  rules and protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
  accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
  (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
  and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
  copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  ìAdditional permissionsî are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
  treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
  they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only
  to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
  permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
  without regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of
  a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions
  from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be
  written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the
  work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to
  a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
  permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
  to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
    names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
    contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
    licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ìfurther
  restrictionsî within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
  you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
  restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
  may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
  document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
  relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
  place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
  that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
  applicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
  stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as
  exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
  it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
  License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph
  of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
  from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
  unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
  your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
  notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
  after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
  permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
  reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
  violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
  you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
  copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
  solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
  copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
  this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
  work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
  acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
  a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
  work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
  compliance by third parties with this License.

  An ìentity transactionî is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
  results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
  receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
  the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
  paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
  work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
  get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
  granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
  license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted
  under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
  is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing
  the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A ìcontributorî is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
  thus licensed is called the contributor's ìcontributor versionî.

  A contributor's ìessential patent claimsî are all patent claims owned or
  controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
  acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
  License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
  include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
  modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
  ìcontrolî includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
  consistent with the requirements of this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
  use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
  the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a ìpatent licenseî is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  sue for patent infringement). To ìgrantî such a patent license to a party
  means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
  against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
  the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
  free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
  available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
  either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)
  arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
  particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
  requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
  recipients. ìKnowingly relyingî means you have actual knowledge that, but
  for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
  your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
  one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason
  to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving
  the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a
  specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
  automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
  based on it.

  A patent license is ìdiscriminatoryî if it does not include within the
  scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
  the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
  granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
  a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
  distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
  based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
  which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the
  covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
  with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
  those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
  products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
  entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior
  to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
  implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
  available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot use,
  propagate or convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
  obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
  as a consequence you may not use, propagate or convey it at all. For
  example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
  further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
  you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
  entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Offering the Program as a Service.

  If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version
  available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source
  Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the
  terms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or
  modified version available to third parties as a service includes,
  without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the
  functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a
  computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or
  primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or
  offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the
  Program or modified version.

  ìService Source Codeî means the Corresponding Source for the Program or
  the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that
  you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service,
  including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces,
  application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software,
  backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a
  user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code
  you make available.  

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  MongoDB, Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Server Side
  Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
  problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
  specifies that a certain numbered version of the Server Side Public
  License ìor any later versionî applies to it, you have the option of
  following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
  any later version published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not
  specify a version number of the Server Side Public License, you may
  choose any version ever published by MongoDB, Inc.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
  the Server Side Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
  of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
  version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
  holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ìAS ISî WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
  16. Limitation of Liability.
  
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
  ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
  THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
  LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
  OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
  cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
  courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
  waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
  warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
  return for a fee.

SIL Open Font License 1.1

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

-------------------------------

PREAMBLE

This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of the fonts.  

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.  

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as received under this licence.  

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.  

"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a copyright ownership of the Font Software.  

"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.  

To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such rights are reserved.  

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to the below conditions:  

1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine- readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.  

2) The font name complies with the following:

(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.

(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.

(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of the new work, appended to that name.  

3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with their explicit written permission.  

4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software, except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this licence.  

TERMINATION

This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.  

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

SIL Open Font License 1.1

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
