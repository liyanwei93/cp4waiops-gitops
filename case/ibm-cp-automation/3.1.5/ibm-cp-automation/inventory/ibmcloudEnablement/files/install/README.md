IBM Cloud Pak&reg; for Business Automation

# Introduction

## Summary
IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation is a modular set of integrated software, built for any hybrid cloud, that quickly solves your toughest operational challenges. It includes the broadest set of AI-powered automation capabilities in the market – content, capture, decisions, workflows, and tasks – with a flexible model that lets you start small and scale up as your needs evolve. Get started with RPA to free up human employees, speed decisioning with operational intelligence, and expand to automate key types of work across core operations. All of which can be tailored to integrate with your existing investments. With actionable AI-generated recommendations, built-in analytics to measure impact, and business-friendly tooling to speed innovation, our software has helped clients reduce process completion times by 90% [1], decrease customer wait times by half [2]  and save thousands of work hours that were then reallocated to higher value work [3].
